Welcome to the organization dedicated to building elegant, modular, and developer-friendly tools for the ROS2 ecosystem.

## 🧭 Mission
To simplify, accelerate, and enrich the robotics development experience through well-designed ROS2 software tools — from environment setup to system orchestration.

## 🚀 What We Build
- 🧱 **ROS2 CLI Tools** – Simplify and enhance day-to-day ROS2 development.
- 🖥️ **Virtualized Dev Environments** – One-click Vagrant and Docker-based setups for ROS2.
- 🔌 **VSCode Extensions** – Native integration with Visual Studio Code to improve dev productivity.
- 🧪 **Testing & Simulation Utilities** – Streamline CI/CD and simulation workflows.
- 🧰 **Modular Packages** – Clean, reusable components for navigation, communication, and introspection.

## 🌏 Philosophy
Inspired by Japanese principles of precision (精度), elegance (優雅), and harmony (調和), our tools are designed to empower developers with minimal friction and maximum control.

## 📦 Projects
